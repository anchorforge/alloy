# TODO

* Refactor code so that it is as simple and concise as possible.
* Think about what would happen if we added a different module type
* Add some basic tests? Not sure what to test there
* Add a github action that checks if the output of replace generation changes anything in the go.mod file
  * Could we also add a pre-commit hook for that? 
* Fill out this readme
